## Description

Wondering how to keep your application config from getting outdated? Looking for a way to future-proof it in a backwards-compatible manner, keeping previous versions reproducible? Join this talk, we’ll share how declarative configs can be leveraged to make your code maintainable and reproducible at the same time.

Therefore, an overview across the application config landscape is given – from inputs as cli-args, env-vars, and config-files, to their representations in code, covering serialization & deserialization, type-safety with config-schemas and evolutions. We’ll recommend cherries to pick for a maintainable and expressive declarative config system.
